description: "Getting up to speed with the Astro framework for portfolio + blog creation"
---

It's high time for another shot at a personal website. I &mdash; like many other developers I'm sure &mdash; have left our personal blogs to languish over time as life has inevitably gotten in the way.

A lot has changed since my last blog post was published in <**_checks notes_**> 2019. Since then, we've eschewed `create-react-app` for meta-frameworks like Next.js and Remix, challengers to React have emerged in Vue.js, Svelte, and Solid, and entirely new UI architectures have been introduced, a la Astro's Multi-Page Architecture approach.

The latter sounded particularly interesting, with the ability to bring your own JS library for interactivity via Astro's [island architecture](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/). It seemed perfect for a personal blog/portfolio, so here we are.

I'll be kicking the tires on Astro for the foreseeable future. In the meantime, I hope to provide some value in the way of learnings from my professional experience.
