## Hardware

- 2023 14-inch MacBook Pro
- ZSA Moonlander Mark 1 Keyboard
  - I decided to be proactive in saving my wrists from RSI and invest in an ergonomic keyboard. I've tried the Kinesis Advantage 360, as well as the MoErgo keyboard, but I
    keep coming back to the Moonlander. The only thing missing that would make this keyboard perfect would be Bluetooth support.
- 27" Studio Display
- Herman Miller Aeron Chair
- Logitech MX Master 3S Mouse

## Software

- VSCode
- iTerm2
